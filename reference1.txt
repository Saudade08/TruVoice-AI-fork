Student SLP: Alex, earlier you mentioned feeling anxious about speaking in public due to concerns about being misgendered. Can you tell me more about a recent experience where this happened? 

Alex: Sure. Just last week, I was at a caf√©, and when I ordered, the barista called me "sir." It was embarrassing, and I didn't know how to respond. 

Student SLP: That sounds really challenging. How did that experience affect you afterward? 

Alex: It ruined my day. I felt like all the progress I've made didn't matter. It made me question if I'll ever be seen as who I truly am. 

Student SLP: I'm sorry you went through that. How often do these kinds of situations occur for you? 

Alex: More often than I'd like to admit. It's like a constant reminder that I don't fit in. 

Student SLP: I can understand how that would be disheartening. How do you usually cope when these situations happen? 

Alex: Honestly, I tend to withdraw. I avoid social situations where I have to speak, which isn't helping me build confidence. 

Student SLP: It's understandable to want to protect yourself from these painful experiences. What support systems do you have in place to help you through these times? 

Alex: I have a few close friends who are supportive, but I haven't really talked to them about these specific incidents. 

Student SLP: It sounds like you have a supportive circle. How do you feel about discussing these experiences with them? 

Alex: I guess it could help, but I don't want to burden them or seem like I'm complaining. 

Student SLP: It's natural to feel that way. What do you think might happen if you shared your feelings with them? 

Alex: They'd probably be supportive and understanding. Maybe I'm just overthinking it. 

Student SLP: It's okay to have these concerns. Building a support network is crucial. How can we incorporate strategies into our sessions to help you feel more confident in these situations? 

Alex: I think practicing responses to misgendering and working on my voice to reduce these occurrences would be helpful. 

Student SLP: That sounds like a solid plan. We'll focus on voice techniques and also role-play scenarios to help you navigate these interactions more comfortably.
