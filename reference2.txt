Characters: 

• 

Jordan: A student SLP using he/him pronouns. 

•

(Dialogue Begins) 

Jordan: "Good morning, Alex. My name is Jordan, and I'm a graduate student in speech-language pathology. I use he/him pronouns. How are you doing today?" 

Alex: "Hi, Jordan. I’m doing okay, thanks. A little nervous, I guess, but also ready to get started." 

Jordan: “Thank you for sharing that, Alex. I know starting something new can bring up all kinds of feelings. Before we dive in, I want to make sure I’m being as respectful as possible. So, could you tell me your full name, the name you prefer to use, and your pronouns? This helps me make sure I am always addressing you correctly."1 

Alex: "Sure. My full name is Alexandra Taylor, but I prefer to go by Alex. My pronouns are she/her." 

Jordan: "Thank you, Alex. I appreciate you sharing that. I’ll make a note to use your preferred name and pronouns. It’s really important to me that our communication is affirming, and that means using the right name and pronouns. Please correct me at any time if I mess up."1... 

Alex: “I appreciate that, Jordan.” 

Jordan: "Absolutely. Now, to make sure our records are accurate and respectful, would it be okay if I update your preferred name and pronouns in our system? We want to make sure that your chosen name and pronouns are reflected in all our communication. This is part of creating a safe and affirming space for you."3... 

Alex: "Yes, please. That would be great. It can be frustrating when people use my legal name." 

Jordan: "I understand. And so, for the sake of the record, could you also share your legal name and any other pertinent information that may be needed? This information will remain confidential and is only used when it's absolutely necessary. We’re committed to protecting your privacy."4... 

Alex: "Okay, my legal name is Alexander Taylor." 

Jordan: "Got it. Thanks, Alex. I want to assure you that from this point forward, I will always use Alex and she/her when addressing you. If at any time you prefer a different name or pronouns, please, feel free to let me know. Your identity and how you wish to be addressed is most important."1... 

Alex: "Thank you, Jordan. I really appreciate that." 

Jordan: “Of course, Alex. I am glad to hear that. I also want to add that I am committed to my own JEDI journey, which includes a commitment to equity and inclusivity. I may still make mistakes as I am still learning, but I am deeply committed to this work.”6... 

Jordan: "Now that we've taken care of these essential details, we can start discussing why you’re here and how I can best support you. Our work together will always be client-centered, and we will adjust our approach based on your specific needs and goals. You are the expert in your own experience."2... 

(Dialogue Ends) 

Key Concepts and Practices Used in the Dialogue: 

• 

Client-Centered Approach: Jordan prioritizes Alex's preferences and affirms her identity by asking for and using her preferred name and pronouns. This is consistent with a person-centered approach10... and is key to culturally responsive care5... which honors a client’s lived experience14. 

• 

Respectful Data Collection: Jordan explains the need for legal name while assuring confidentiality and prioritizing the use of preferred name and pronouns1. 

• 

Affirming Language: Jordan uses language that is respectful and inclusive, signaling a commitment to providing a safe space for Alex, and acknowledges that gender may be binary, nonbinary, nonexistent, or change over time2.... 

• 

Transparency: Jordan states his intention to make sure he is using Alex's preferred name and pronouns, and invites corrections if he makes a mistake4. The dialogue also highlights Jordan's commitment to ongoing professional development to understand his own biases and to provide gender-affirming voice care.7 

• 

Cultural Humility: Jordan is aware that he does not have lived experience with gender diversity and indicates that he will make efforts to be aware of cultural norms that are outside of his own.15 He also demonstrates that he understands that his role is to support, not to direct the therapy process.16 

• 

Emphasis on Agency: Jordan uses language that empowers Alex to advocate for herself by reassuring her that her chosen identity is important.17 

• 

Acknowledging and Addressing Power Imbalances: Jordan acknowledges that he may cause unintentional harm through his actions as he is still learning, and offers transparency as a way to address those power imbalances.18 

This revised dialogue demonstrates how a new SLP can begin the therapeutic relationship in a way that is both respectful and affirming, aligning with best practices in GAVC. It integrates insights from the sources related to the importance of preferred names and pronouns, and transparency with clients.
