Transition History: Monae Jackson, born Montez Naethaniel Jackson, is a 32-year-old (3/14/1993) software engineer who came out as transgender woman (transwoman) and began her transition journey two years ago. Despite making significant strides in her transition, including starting HRT (hormone replacement therapy), legally changing her name and gender marker, and updating her appearance to better reflect her identity as a woman, Monae continues to struggle with intense gender dysphoria related to her voice.
From a young age, Monae has battled discomfort with how low, deep and traditionally masculine her natural speaking voice sounds. As a child of 8 or 9, she recalls praying tearfully for God to change her voice and feeling deeply distressed whenever she was complimented for having a "strong, manly voice." Puberty, and the testosterone-fueled changes it brought, only exacerbated Monae's voice-related dysphoria. However, growing up in a conservative family and community, she repressed her identity and tried to push away the pain of hearing a voice that didn't feel like hers every time she spoke.
Monae first realized she was transgender at age 19 in college, but didn't come out or transition for over a decade due to fears about rejection from her tight-knit family. Her parents Michael (65) and Angela (63), devout Christians with traditional views, had made disparaging remarks about LGBTQ people throughout Monae's life. Her older brother Joseph (36) had also made crude jokes about trans women on several occasions. Monae's younger sister Aaliyah (28), with whom she had an extremely close bond growing up, held conservative religious beliefs and often expressed that being transgender was unnatural and immoral. Terrified of losing her family's love and support, especially her sister's, Monae hid her identity, despite the profound pain it caused her. She also worried that transitioning would jeopardize her career in the male-dominated tech industry.
It wasn't until age 30, when the distress of living inauthentically had led Monae into a deep depression, that she finally decided she couldn't keep denying her truth. After coming out to her queer best friend Reyna (31), who offered unconditional support and encouragement, Monae took the leap and came out to her family, friends and workplace. Her parents, although struggling to understand at first, ultimately affirmed their love for Monae. Her brother Joseph had a harder time accepting the news but is slowly making an effort to be supportive.
However, Monae's sister Aaliyah reacted with anger, confusion and rejection. She accused Monae of betraying their family, their faith and her "true self as Montez." Aaliyah refused to use Monae's new name and pronouns and cut off contact with her. This fractured relationship with the sister she had once been so close to has been a profound source of pain amidst Monae's transition journey.
Monae's software company was extremely supportive of her transition at work. Now, two years into her transition, Monae is read as a woman based on her appearance but being addressed as "sir" on the phone or in drive-thrus shatters that affirmation in seconds. Each incident cuts deeply, leaving Monae feeling devastated, dysphoric, and discouraged for days afterwards. She dreads making phone calls and avoids using drive-thru windows for this reason.
In professional contexts, as one of the only women, and the only out trans woman, at her software company, Monae already faces misogynistic microaggressions and bias regularly. When she has to give presentations to colleagues or clients, her anxiety skyrockets, worrying that her masculine-sounding voice will undermine perceptions of her as a competent professional and validate sexist attitudes towards women in STEM. After one presentation where she was talked over and dismissed by the male client, Monae overheard a colleague say "well what do you expect with a voice like that," reinforcing her fears.
Socially, Monae finds herself holding back from speaking up in group conversations, especially with people she doesn't know well. She feels extremely self-conscious about drawing attention to her voice. On several occasions when she has tried to speak in a more feminine way around her family, Monae received unsupportive comments from her brother Joseph saying she sounded "fake" or "ridiculous" and questioning why she wouldn't just use her "real" voice. Aaliyah has also made hurtful remarks, intentionally deadnaming Monae as Montez and telling her "I'll never see you as a real woman, especially when you talk like that." These responses shamed Monae and made her even more hesitant to experiment with changing her voice, even though being perceived as male when she speaks causes significant distress.
Six months ago, Monae found an online support community for trans women and began posting about her struggles with vocal dysphoria. She was surprised by how many other women shared her experiences. Many of them posted powerful stories of how voice feminization training with a skilled speech-language pathologist (SLP) had been lifechanging, enabling them to align their voice with their true self. The women raved about the confidence, euphoria and freedom they now felt speaking in a voice that matched their feminine identity. Some even shared incredible before-and-after voice clips documenting their progress.
Seeing what was possible gave Monae a surge of hope and motivation. After researching the field of transgender voice and communication therapy, Monae reached out to an SLP who specializes in this area. Though part of her is nervous, Monae mostly feels a profound sense of excitement and readiness. After years of pain and discomfort, she is determined to finally uncover her true voice. At her initial assessment appointment, Monae shares:
"My voice has always felt like a disconnect - a remnant of Montez, a false version of myself. When I speak and hear this deep, masculine voice, it's a punch in the gut every time, an instant reminder that the world still sees me as a man no matter how I look. It makes me feel so self-conscious and dysphoric that I hold myself back in every area of life.
My sister's rejection of my identity, and the way she weaponizes my voice to deny my womanhood, has been so painful. But I refuse to let that stop me from becoming my authentic self. I'm done living silenced by my own voice. I know Monae's real voice is inside me, and I'm ready to put in the work to find her.
Learning to speak in a way that reflects the woman I am will be so liberating - the final piece to living fully as myself. I can't wait to feel the joy and confidence of having my voice and identity aligned. I know it won't be easy, but I've never been more motivated to do the work to make it happen."
