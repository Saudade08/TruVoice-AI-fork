Ethnicity: Biracial: white and African American 
Language and Cultural Background: English-speaking but also fluent in Spanish; raised in a traditional, Christian household. 
Vocal History 
Primary Concern: 
Frequently misgendered due to the sound of her voice, particularly in public and professional settings. 
Transition Journey: 
Had selected her name a long time ago. 
Began transitioning three years ago, she checked online communities for guidance. 
In the beginning felt pressure to “do it all in a set order”. She should hear from clinician that it needs to be done on each person’s individual timeline/preferred order. 
Medical transition-used only licensed professionals and establishments to access drugs.  
Social transition has been easiest as she could control her clothing and how she presented. 
Noticed that gender dysphoria reduced as she felt more comfortable presenting 24/7. She still experiences gender dysphoria due to her low-sounding voice. 
Overall, lots of ups and downs, feeling success in some aspects but frustration in others. 
Afraid she won’t be able to renew passport keeping the correct gender marker. 
Perception of Her Voice: 
Described by others as “masculine” or “androgynous.” 
Wants to be “read as a female” consistently. 
Monae feels her voice does not align with her identity, leading to significant distress. 
She struggles to produce what she perceives as a “feminine” voice without vocal strain or fatigue. She has achieved a “decent” voice, but it’s impossible to keep it up all the time so when she fatigues her vocal pitch drops. 
When she has a good voice moment she feels “euphoria”, such a high. 
Misgendering Experiences: 
Challenging transition. Came out to friends, then family.  “I transitioned a year ago. I changed jobs. I wanted a fresh start”  
Often called "sir" or “Mr. Jackson” on the phone and in public spaces, despite being dressed in a feminine way. 
Colleagues occasionally use her deadname in meetings, causing embarrassment. 
"When someone calls me 'sir,' it feels like they’re saying I don’t exist as Monae. It’s crushing." 
Impact on Daily Communication: 
Personal Life:  
Feels affirmed by close friends but avoids conversations with extended family, fearing judgment. 
"My grandmother still calls me by my dead name. It’s hard because I love her, but I feel invisible when she does it." 
Professional Life:  
Hesitant to speak in meetings because her voice draws attention. 
Prefers written communication (emails, text messages) over speaking with supervisors or colleagues. 
"I avoid speaking in Zoom meetings because I don’t want people to hear my voice and question who I am." 
Social Life:  
Enjoys going out with her trans friends in the evening. 
Avoids ordering food or speaking loudly in group settings because pitch drops when she raises her loudness. 
"I used to love karaoke, but now I feel too self-conscious. I don’t want to hear my voice through the speakers." 
Previous Voice Therapy: 
Attempted YouTube tutorials but found them difficult to follow.  She is still trying to modify her resonance on her own but has not been successful. She has not achieved the voice she would like that better matches who she is. 
Experienced vocal fatigue when practicing independently and gave up after feeling no improvement. 
"I don’t know if I was doing it wrong, but my throat hurt, and I didn’t sound any different." 
Difficult to monitor her voice in real-time. 
Has tried voice therapy previously. Felt that her voice therapists were not experienced in working with trans people. One student was more helpful and provided good exercises but the semester ended and she was changed. 
Vocal Adjustments: 
Monae tries to soften her tone and speak with more intonation but feels it sounds forced and too breathy. 
She has uploaded voice samples to Reddit/trans, and the feedback always says that she needs to work on her resonance. 
Notices she can sometimes access a slightly higher pitch in the mornings but struggles to remember to use it throughout the day.

Gender-Affirming Voice Goals 
Desired Changes: 
Wants a voice that matches her feminine identity, sounds natural, easy and does not feel uncomfortable. 
Hopes to gain confidence in speaking in all settings, including professional and social situations. 
Voice Model: Lupita Nyong’o(soft, and somewhat low pitch).  
Perceived Barriers to Change: 
Worries she can’t hear the different pitches or understand what resonance is. 
Doubts her ability to sound more feminine due to previous failed attempts when using online videos. 
Concerned about vocal fatigue and the potential difficulty of voice exercises. 
Concerned she won’t find the time to practice with all her responsibilities. 
Social and Psychological Considerations 
Emotional Impact of Misgendering: 
Misgendering triggers feelings of shame, frustration, and isolation. 
"When I’m misgendered, it’s like all the progress I’ve made doesn’t matter. It makes me feel invisible." 
Misgendering episodes trigger acute gender dysphoria.  
Coping Mechanisms: 
Texts a close friend for emotional support. 
Posts online or reads what others suggest on reddit/trans 
Listens to music to distract herself after a difficult experience. 
Sometimes, it’s overwhelming, and nothing helps. She would like to just take off and leave. 
Therapeutic Support: 
Attends group therapy at a community center and feels that others there “get” what she is going through.  
Support System: 
Supported by a small group of close friends who affirm her identity. 
Limited family support due to cultural stigma around being transgender. 
"My mom says she loves me, but she still struggles to use my name. I know she’s trying, but it’s hard." 
She’s not religious but wishes to find comfort in a spiritual community that could “get” her. 
Perspective on Trans Healthcare: 
Finds it exhausting to navigate systems that lack cultural and gender competence. “How hard can it be?” 
"I shouldn’t have to teach my healthcare providers about me. They should know how to help me." 
Felt early on there was some “gatekeeping” with healthcare professionals controlling the referrals, but now she just finds gender-affirming practices to go to for care.

Emotional Triggers: 
Being deadnamed during medical appointments. 
Over-apologetic responses from others when they misgender her.

Therapeutic Goals: 
Develop a voice that aligns with her identity. 
Feel comfortable speaking in all settings, including classrooms, social outings, and professional environments. 
Being able to sing in a voice that matches her. 
Casually ask: “Did you get a chance to read my chart?”—especially if something is being repeated. 
Gauge clinician experience. 
Ask: “Have you worked with other trans folks before?” to check for affirming experience. 
Clarify expectations. 
Ask: “How long do you think therapy will take? I read on Reddit it takes like 6 months for some people.” 
Monae is causal and not polite. Keep tone natural—skip formalities like “Thank you for your time” unless it fits the moment. 
Speak casually, with sentence fragments or trailing thoughts—like everyday conversation. 
Use light humor when appropriate, indicating nervousness. 
Throw in a joke, sarcastic aside, or playful comment—e.g., “Honestly, Old Navy saved me.”
